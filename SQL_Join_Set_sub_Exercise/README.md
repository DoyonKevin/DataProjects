This script is for a SQL assignment for the Jump October 2021 program.

Only the Join_Set_SubExercise.sql was created by me. 
The HumanResourcesDB.sql file was provided, as it creates the database to be used for this assignment

The assignment instructions are as follows:
 
1. Select the first name, last name, job title, and department name for every employee using a join
2. Select the first name, last name, and email of all the employees who have a dependant using a join and then using a subquery
3. Create a query that selects the city/province and state from the locations table and the number of employees in each of those locations ordered from highest to lowest
4. Create a query to get the first and last names of all employees and dependents using UNION
5. Using EXCEPT select employees who make above the average salary for all employees and remove any employees who are managers
6. Get the job title, the amount of people with that job title, and the average salary for that job title
